# ComfyUI-docker
The goal of this project is to create a working docker image running ComfyUI capable of running on shared computing services like RunPod with the nodes and models that I use.  It's not the goal to create an image for public consuption, but feel free to fork it and change it to fit your wants/needs/desires.
